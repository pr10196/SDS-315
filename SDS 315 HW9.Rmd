```

## Problem 1


## Part A

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)

turnout <- read.csv("turnout.csv")
head(turnout)

# Calculated proportion of those receiving a GOTV call who voted in 1998
propVotedGOTV <- mean(turnout$voted1998[turnout$GOTV_call == 1])

#Calculated sample proportion of those not receiving a GOTV call who voted in 1998
propVotedNoGOTV <- mean(turnout$voted1998[turnout$GOTV_call == 0])

numGOTV <- sum(turnout$GOTV_call == 1)
numNoGOTV <- sum(turnout$GOTV_call == 0)

seDiffProp <- sqrt(propVotedGOTV * (1 - propVotedGOTV) / numGOTV + propVotedNoGOTV * (1 - propVotedNoGOTV) / numNoGOTV)

diffProp <- propVotedGOTV - propVotedNoGOTV
ciLower <- diffProp - 1.96 * seDiffProp
ciUpper <- diffProp + 1.96 * seDiffProp
```


## Part B

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(turnout, aes(x = AGE, fill = factor(GOTV_call))) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~ MAJORPTY) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Density", fill = "Received GOTV Call") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Part C

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Perform matching based on confounding variables
matchingVariables <- matchit(GOTV_call ~ voted1996 + AGE + MAJORPTY, data = turnout, method = "nearest", ratio = 5)

# Create matched dataset
matchedDataset <- match.data(matchingVariables)

# Calculate proportions and confidence interval in the matched dataset
propVotedGOTV_matched <- mean(matchedDataset$voted1998[matchedDataset$GOTV_call == 1], na.rm = TRUE)
propVotedNoGOTV_matched <- mean(matchedDataset$voted1998[matchedDataset$GOTV_call == 0], na.rm = TRUE)

numGOTV_matched <- sum(matchedDataset$GOTV_call == 1)
numNoGOTV_matched <- sum(matchedDataset$GOTV_call == 0)

# Calculate difference in proportions
diffProp_matched <- propVotedGOTV_matched - propVotedNoGOTV_matched

# Calculate standard error of the difference in proportions
seDiffProp_matched <- sqrt(propVotedGOTV_matched * (1 - propVotedGOTV_matched) / numGOTV_matched + propVotedNoGOTV_matched * (1 - propVotedNoGOTV_matched) / numNoGOTV_matched)

# Calculate 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions
ciLower_matched <- diffProp_matched - 1.96 * seDiffProp_matched
ciUpper_matched <- diffProp_matched + 1.96 * seDiffProp_matched

# Output results for matched dataset
cat("Proportion of matched GOTV recipients who voted in 1998:", propVotedGOTV_matched, "\n")
cat("Proportion of matched non-GOTV recipients who voted in 1998:", propVotedNoGOTV_matched, "\n")
cat("95% Confidence Interval for the difference in proportions (matched data):", ciLower_matched, "-", ciUpper_matched, "\n")



## FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## ANSWER THE QUESTION: What do you conclude about the overall effect of the GOTV call on the likelihood of voting in the 1998 election?

## Problem 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
solder <- read.csv("solder.csv")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Part A

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(solder, aes(x = Opening, y = skips)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Impact of Opening Size on Skips",
       x = "Size of Opening on Solder Gun",
       y = "Number of Skips")


ggplot(solder, aes(x = Solder, y = skips)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Solder Thickness and Skips",
       x = "Alloy Thickness (Solder)",
       y = "Count of Skips")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(moderndive)

model <- lm(skips ~ Opening * Solder, data = solder)
regressionTable <- get_regression_table(model)
regressionTable
